## Blockly

Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to build programs.  All code is free and open source.

**The project page is https://developers.google.com/blockly/**

You use this git repo to build the `msg` directory and the `blockly-compressed.js` for the Open-Roberta lab.

### Build the Resources for the Open-Roberta Lab

On linux systems one possibility is

- you have the closure-library next to this project (you need version 20200719.0.0)
- you have installed the closure compiler via npm: 
  - e.g. `npm install --save google-closure-compiler`
  - check the version: `npx google-closure-compiler --version` => `v20200719`
- you have installed python 2.7 (:-<) 
- run the `build.py` script

A better solution on both linux and windows systems is

- you have installed docker
- `docker run --mount type=bind,source=:your-blockly-git:,destination=/opt/blockly/blockly openroberta/blocklybuilder:1.0.0`
- in this case no python 2 installation, no closure compiler installation, no closure compiler resources

### Workflow

- you have cloned the blockly git https://github.com/OpenRoberta/blockly.git into `:your-blockly-git:`
- you have a feature branch `git checkout -b feature/myChanges`
- you edit a file in the `blocks` folder to add or change a blockly block and edit the file
  `robMsg/robMessages.js` to add or change a message and then re-build the resources. Use one of the possibilities
  described above. *Never* change a file in the `msg` folder, because these changes would be overwritten by the next build.
- check your changes in the blockly playground found in the directory `tests`. One of the many playgrounds will fit your need.
  You may copy one and modify it. If you are satisfies with your results, continue.
- try your results in the Open-Roberta lab: copy the `msg` directory and the `blockly-compressed.js` into
  `:your-openroberta-lab-git:/OpenrobertaServer/staticResources/blockly`. If you are satisfies with your results, continue.
- rebase on master: `git fetch;git rebase master`
- merge to master: `git checkout master;git merge feature/myChanges;git push`
- later delete your feature branch `git branch -d feature/myChanges`
- your changes to blockly are now persisted in the `blockly` repo **and** in your `:your-openroberta-lab-git:`. In the feature
  you'll commit these changes in the feature branch and eventually you'll merge your changes to `develop`.
  
Note, that the `blockly` repo only provides a `master` branch. There is no high traffix with this repo and thus it ok to
simplify the repo structure.
